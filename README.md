Hello, this is our first team project.  

The goal of the project was to create a
responsive web page according to the layout. We were given 6 days in total. On
the first day, we distributed responsibilities and started working hard. Over
the next 4 days, our team created the website according to the technical task
and passed all the checks. On the last day, we improved the optimization and
made the last fixes.
